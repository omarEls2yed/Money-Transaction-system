# Money-Transaction-system (MTS)

# Overview :

money transaction systems aim to provide a secure, convenient, and efficient means for users to manage their finances and make electronic transactions. Keep in mind that features may vary, and new functionalities may be added as technology and user needs evolve.

# Getting started :

you need c++ compiler and visual studio to run the code in your pc

# scenario :

Meet Sarah, a young professional who enjoys dining out with friends.
One evening, Sarah and her friends decide to have dinner at a new restaurant in town. 
After an enjoyable meal, it's time to settle the bill. 
The waiter informs them that they can only accept one payment for the entire table.

Here's where Sarah encounters the need for a money transaction system:

Limited Cash: Sarah doesn't have enough cash on hand to cover her share of the bill, and she realizes that her friends are in a similar situation.

Convenience: Instead of dealing with the hassle of splitting the bill in cash or waiting for friends to transfer money later, Sarah suggests using a money transaction system like mine.

Instant Transfer: Sarah opens her app, selects the option to send money, and enters the total bill amount. She then selects her friends from her contact list and splits the bill equally.

Real-Time Notifications: Sarah's friends instantly receive notifications about the payment request. They confirm the request and use their own money transaction apps to transfer their respective shares.

Confirmation: Sarah receives real-time notifications confirming that her friends have paid their portions. The entire process takes only a few minutes, allowing the group to leave the restaurant without
worrying about cash or complicated bill-splitting calculations.

Transaction History: Sarah and her friends can later review the transaction history in their apps to keep track of the dinner expense and payments.
